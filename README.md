# Better Coder

**What it is:** The source code behind the site bettercoder.net

**Purpose:** The point of having this site's code open source is not only to try to lead by example but to learn from the community as well. As someone new to rails and test driven development there's bound to be a lot of correctable mistakes made. 

It will also be interesting to see if it being open source leads to some fun site hacks & defacement. If you do manage to hack it, be kind enough to provide the details so some learning can take place at the same time.
